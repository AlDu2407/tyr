# Tyr - My language experiment

## Goal

I was thinking about a project to learn C++ with. I've been developing in Java for so long, I wanted to do something different for a change. I might not be as active as some other developers but I try to do my best.

Another goal for `Tyr` is to compile it to machine code using assembly and `fasm`. It will be an undertaking - the last time I did something in assembly was at university - but it might be fun. 

Anyways, let's go.
